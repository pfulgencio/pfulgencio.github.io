	<p class="text-center">If all sources of food were the same size, had the same texture, with the same aroma and even the same color and flavor but with different nutritional values, we could survive on these assortments; however, this would be more of fullfilment of a necesity and not an artful joy that food can be and is. Each day, we learn new thing. Somethimes these new things come to us volunterly, like well prepared meals and other times they come to us unvolunterly like meals that helps us to simply surive. This tribute page is for the ones that are not satisfy with sole nutrition, with learning what we can not avoid but for the ones that go one ore more steps forward, for the ones that life is like a tasting room of irresisteble delights and will not say "I have tasted enough, I have found the flavor I was looking for, why sample more?". </p>



	<h2 id="bullet-title">Are there many people out there that feel the same way?</h2>

		
		<p class="text-center">Yes. There is many people that like to constatnly learn something new. Our goal is not to adquire knoledge. Our goal is to cross the vail that separates an unexplored land and experience what is hidden. Once we arrive to this new land, we, for the most part, won't stay long and must move on to the next adventure. There are other lands that we never leave because of necessity. As long as our physical capacity allows it, we will continue to explore and will never be able to resist trying something new. </p>
